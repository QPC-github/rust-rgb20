# RGB-20 Library

RGB20 is an RGB schema for fungible digital assets on bitcoin & lightning.

This repository provides rust library and a command-line utility `rgb20` which
can be used alongside RGB Node to generate and parse RGB20 data (schema, issue
assets, interpret contract information returned by RGB Node).
